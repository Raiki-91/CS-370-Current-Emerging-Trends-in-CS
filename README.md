## Portfolio for CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS

This project involved implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm to train an intelligent agent, represented by a pirate, to navigate a maze and find the treasure. The provided code included the `TreasureMaze` class, which defined the maze environment, pirate interactions, and reward mechanisms. Additionally, the `GameExperience` class was provided to manage experience replay, storing episodes, and fetching training data for the neural network. A skeleton for the Q-learning model and utility functions for visualization were also included. My contribution focused on implementing the training logic in the `qtrain` function. This involved creating a training loop, managing episodes, updating Q-values through backpropagation, and dynamically adjusting the exploration factor. I also tracked performance metrics such as win rate and loss, optimized the training process with exploration decay, and ensured the final pirate position in the maze was accurately displayed after training.

This project highlights how computer scientists solve complex problems by designing algorithms, developing software, and implementing systems to address real-world challenges. In this case, I used reinforcement learning to automate decision-making, demonstrating applications in pathfinding, logistics, and even video game AI. Computer scientists approach problems methodically, starting with understanding the requirements, analyzing constraints, developing a basic solution, and refining it iteratively through testing and feedback. By evaluating performance metrics and optimizing parameters, I ensured the solution was efficient and effective.

Ethically, computer scientists have responsibilities to both the end user and the organization. To users, they must ensure systems are safe, reliable, and free from biases, while protecting privacy and security. To organizations, they must deliver solutions that are efficient, maintainable, and adhere to ethical standards, avoiding shortcuts that could compromise quality or trust. This structured and ethical approach ensures that projects are impactful, trustworthy, and aligned with professional standards in the field of computer science.
